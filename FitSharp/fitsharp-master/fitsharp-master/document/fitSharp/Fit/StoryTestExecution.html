<div class="pagename">Story Test Execution</div>
<div class="content">In the standard mode of story test execution, each fixture processes a single table, with the fixture name in the first cell of the table. <pre class="test">|fixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|fixtureB|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> <a href="../Fit/DoFixture.html">Do Fixture</a> and Sequence Fixture (and any fixture derived from Flow Fixture Base) can also operate in <a href="../Fit/FlowMode.html">Flow Mode</a>, processing all the tables on the story test page without repeating the fixture name in each table. These fixtures are known as flow fixtures. When a flow fixture appears in the first cell of the first table, it operates in <a href="../Fit/FlowMode.html">Flow Mode</a>. <pre class="test">|flowFixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|xxx|xxx|</pre> If a flow fixture appears after the first table, it operates in standard mode. <pre class="test">|fixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|flowFixtureB|
|xxx|xxx|

|fixtureC|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> A fixture can "hide" itself, so that a subsequent flow fixture will appear to be in the first table, and thus operate in <a href="../Fit/FlowMode.html">Flow Mode</a>. <a href="../Fit/ImportFixture.html">Import Fixture</a> and <a href="../Fit/FitVersionFixture.html">Fit Version Fixture</a> are examples of hidden fixtures. The hidden fixture overrides the IsVisible property: <pre class="code">public class MyHiddenFixture: Fixture {
    public override bool IsVisible { get { return false; } }
...}</pre><pre class="test">|myHiddenFixture|
|xxx|xxx|

|flowFixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|xxx|xxx|</pre> A flow fixture can use a different rule to determine when to operate in <a href="../Fit/FlowMode.html">Flow Mode</a>, by overriding the IsInFlow metohd: <pre class="code">public class MyGreedyFixture: FlowFixtureBase {
    public override bool IsInFlow(int tableCount) { return true; }
...}</pre><pre class="test">|fixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|myGreedyFixture|
|xxx|xxx|

|xxx|xxx|</pre> In the tables above, the fixture class name appears in the first cell. If this cell contains a class name that doesn't inherit from Fixture, then a <a href="../Fit/DoFixture.html">Do Fixture</a> is created with the class as its <a href="../Fit/SystemUnderTest.html">System Under Test</a>. <pre class="test">|myDomainClass|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> is a shorthand for <pre class="test">|do|
|start|myDomainClass|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> If the first cell isn't a class name at all, a Do Fixture is still created. In this case, the first cell will have to be one of the <a href="../Fit/FlowFixtureKeywords.html">Flow Fixture Keywords</a> or a procedure from a <a href="../Fit/DefineFixture.html">Define Fixture</a> in a Suite Set Up page. <pre class="test">|with|new|myDomainClass|xxx|xxx|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> or <pre class="test">|myProcedure|xxx|xxx|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> <br>
